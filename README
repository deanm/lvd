Turn your desktop to folder list view.  This is convenient for the unorganized
who like having a thousand files on their desktop.

Build using the MSVC compiler:
  cl listview.c user32.lib

You'll probably want to add this to startup, for example the registry key:
  HKLM/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Run
